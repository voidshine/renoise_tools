# renoise_tools
Tools for Renoise, including the `voidshine pyre` controller for Akai Fire.

## About
This is an unfinished hobby project, released "as is" in case it
will be of use to someone. If anyone wants to develop further, add
documentation, etc. then please feel free to submit a pull request.

The best way to learn how to use the tool is to try things out,
watch the Renoise status text, and read the code! The source
language is TypeScript so navigation with VS Code should be friendly.

## Installation

Copy the content of `tools` to your Renoise installation's `Tools` folder, e.g. on
Linux this may be `~/.config/Renoise/V3.3.0/Scripts/Tools`.

## Tools

### pyre

This tool enables use of one or two Fire controllers for navigation, playing,
sequencing, sound control, etc. Efficient position seek and note entry are the
main focus but there are a few interesting features to be found.

#### Configuration
Select the input and output for MIDI communication with the Fire and enable it.

If you want Renoise to enter notes generated by the Fire's remapping note mode
keyboard, you may need to enable the OSC server in Renoise preferences and
configure the tool to use it.
